# ToDoListAzure
This is a simple proof of concept to display an Azure App Service website communciating with an API project, which communicates to an Azure SQL backend.  The app is a To-Do application based on Microsoft's To-Do List app, but adapted for Azure deploy and to Visual Studio 2017 Preview.  The project is C#, Angular JS, and SQL. 

The primary objective of the tutorial is to show you how to deploy an Azure App Service Website + App Service API + Azure SQL and how to get it all working with a simple To-Do application. Also I am reviving the older post to update the project to Visual Studio 2017.  I hope that this is helpful to either enterprise web developers about using Azure and linking a 3 part project, or if you are a beginner this is a good project for you to learn how to code and how to use Azure.  I will only address how to deploy and setup CI/CD in this tutorial. If you are new to coding and wanted to go through what the code is actually doing this is a great beginner project to learn API's and how a simple end-to-end solution works.

The code is based on this tutorial here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-api/app-service-api-dotnet-get-started

Software used in tutorial (other versions should work fine but this is what I used, note I will not be covering how to install these and will assume you have them already or can find another tutorial if needed to install these):
* Visual Studio 2017 Preview
* Sql Server Management Server 2016
* Azure subscription
* Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) for CI/CD portion

### Overview of guide:
**Part 1: Setup the Azure SQL Database**
1. Setup an Azure SQL database using the Azure Portal.  
2. Sign into the database using SQL Server Management Studio
3. Create a table with an ID and Description
4. Create 5 stored procedures

**Part 2: Setup the C# Project**
1. Pull down the GitHub project
2. Make sure it builds locally
3. Test the Azure project connects locally to the Azure SQL DB 
4. Deploy the API project to Azure and ensure it still connects to Azure SQL
5. Test the Web App can connect to tne Azure Web API project you just deployed 
6. Deploy the Web App
7. You should have a working app! Test it out by hitting the web front end website and checking your SQL DB!

**Part 3: Setup a VSTS Account, Multiple Environments, and Continuous Integration**
1. Create a Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) account. 
2. Setup 3 environments: Dev, QA, and Prod
3. Add code for all 3 environments
4. Setup a Continuous Integration Build that triggers on check-in to the code source

**Part 4: Setup VSTS Continuous Deployment, Test Multiple Environments end to end**
1. Setup Continuous Deployment that will deploy to each respective environment once a Successful Continuous Integration Build has been completed
2. Test checking into Dev and see the whole process publish a change to the Dev published website
3. Merge Dev into QA and view the whole process change into the QA published website

# [Part 1]: Setup the Azure SQL Database
1. Go to the Azure Portal at portal.azure.com
2. Create a new SQL Database. Click "+ New", select Databases, choose SQL Database, then lastly hit Create. 
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/01SelectSQLDBPortal.png?raw=true "Azure Portal: how to select a SQL DB")
3. Fill in all of the highlighted inputs.  Click on Server and Pricing Tier to get slideout options.  In the Server slideout, make sure you create a username and password that you will remember, you will need this to login using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  In the Pricing Tier, change to Basic so it only costs about $5 per month. Your screen will look approximately like this:
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/02DBOptions.png?raw=true "Creating a SQL DB")
4. Click on All Resources on the left menu. You should see your new SQL Server and SQL Database. Click on the SQL Database. 
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/03AllResources.png?raw=true "Select your SQL DB")
5. You land on the Overview tab.  Save the Server name from the main Overview tab of your new Azure SQL DB. Click on the Show Connection Strings hyperlink highlighted.
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/05DatabaseOverview.png?raw=true "SQL DB Overview tab")
  The connection string page will look like this (save this in a Notepad for the web.config in the solution later):
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/06ConnectionString.png?raw=true "SQL DB Overview tab")
6. Open SSMS and enter the Server name, username, and password. 
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/07SSMS.png?raw=true "SSMS Login")
7. Create a new table that looks exactly like the following format (two columns which are "ID" and "Description", "ID" should be an int and "Description" should be type VARCHAR(500)).. you can make the description anything you'd like: 

      ID | Description
      ------------ | -------------
      1 | Buy ketchup
      2 | Eat a hot dog
      3 | Hug a puppy

      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/08Table.png?raw=true "Table Structure")

8. Download this whole project, either as a zip file or using Git.  
9. Create the 5 stored procedures which are found in the root project folder (open Stored Procedure in SSMS and hit Execute and since they are "Create Stored Proc" types you should see them appear in the Stored Proc folder as shown in screenshot in next step): ** StoredProcedures **
10. Your Azure SQL database should look something like this now: 
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part1/09StoredProcs.png?raw=true "SSMS Stored Procedures")

# [Part 2]: Setup the C# Project
1. Download this project if you haven't already (your should have in Part 1, step 9 though). 
2. Build the project.
3. Set the ToDoListDataAPI project as the Startup Project. 
4. Run the project. 
5. Add "/swagger" to the end of your URL if it is not already there, you should see a page like this: 
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/01.png?raw=true "Swagger main page")
6. Go to your Azure Portal and get the connection string from your Azure SQL DB. You should have saved this in a Notepad from Part 1, step 5.
7. Add this to your web.config file. Your web.config file should look like this:
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/02.png?raw=true "Web config with Connection String")
8. Save, run your project again, and add the "/swagger" if needed. 
9. Try to run a GET all which is the first API on the page /api/ToDoList, you should see:
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/03.png?raw=true "More Swagger API calls..")
10. Try to run a POST, first click where the screenshot shows, and fill in an ID with 10 and any description you want.  You should see (also check in SSMS and refresh your table):
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/03.png?raw=true "More Swagger API calls..")
11. Try to run a GET all again, you should see your added value:
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/04.png?raw=true "More Swagger API calls..")
12. Try to run a PUT, again click to get the format from where it's shown in the screenshot and modify an existing record's description, remember the ID number is 10 for the next step:
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/05.png?raw=true "More Swagger API calls..")
13. Try to run a GET by ID, use 10:
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/06.png?raw=true "More Swagger API calls..")
14. Your SSMS table should look like this now:
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/07.png?raw=true "SSMS Table Updated")
15. You have now tested all of the APIs and seen that your API project is linked to your Azure SQL DB. 
16. Let's publish the API project, stop running it.  Right click on the project
      ![Alt text](/Images/Part2/08.png?raw=true "Publishing the API project")
17. The settings
18. Hit Publish
19. Verify it shows up in the Azure Portal
20. Let's connect the front end to the API / Azure SQL Project.
21. Run the front end as Startup. It should look like this.
21. Let's do the same publishing to Azure for the front end project
